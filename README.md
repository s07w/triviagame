# Trivial Music Trivia!

## The app

With a music trivia theme, this app will ask trivia questions as a timer counts down from 30 seconds. The user's scores, right guesses, and wrong guesses are saved and displayed at the end. 

## How the app works

The app uses on click events in jQuery, as well as JavaScript for the timer logic. Figuring out the logic for the trivia game was tricky as well. I stored the questions and answers in objects. The timer also has a slight delay because of callbacks, which I want to fix in version two.
